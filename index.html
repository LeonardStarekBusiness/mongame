As the middle age came to an end, humans were about to exterminate all monsters. You are a slime that was sent by his vampire stepfather to free all monsters against all odds.<br><br>

As you learn new skills, your perception of the world changes, and the genre of the game completely changes.<br><br>

You get to choose whether you want to do what your father conditioned you to do: Rely only on your vampire skills. Or you can learn the fighting skill which is taught to you by a guy who doesn´t agree with with your fathers philosophy at all...<br><br>



I am a 17yr old guy who started making this game when I was 15. Since it took 2 years, a donation would be crucial if you liked this and want more of it! This is only the first release, the story will continue if adequate support is shown.<br><br>

IF YOU DONATE, I CAN CREATE CUSTOM STUFF FOR YOU!<br><br>

IF YOU DONATE ATL. 2,50$, you will get access to the Underwater DLC with new skins and a brand new level!<br><br>
